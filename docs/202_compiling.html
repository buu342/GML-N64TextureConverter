<h1>Compiling Images</h1>

<p>
The basic program workflow is very simple. Start by importing an image by
pressing the <img src="images/tile007.png"> <b>Import Image</b> button on
the top left of the menu bar. This will open a folder browser, where you can
search for an image to import. The image must be smaller or equal to 640x480,
and can be in many popular image formats, with and without transparency.
</p>

<p>
On the left side, you can select the color format which your image will be
exported as:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/colorform.png">
</center>

<p>
And the file format:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/exportmode.png">
</center>

<p>
You can preview the exported value of each texel of your imported image by
simply hovering your mouse over it. The value of the pixel, separated by
its components, as well as the final outputted hexadecimal value, is shown
on the bottom right of the screen in a matrix:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/pixelinfo.png">
</center>

<p>
If you are using the Color Index modes, you must generate a palette by pressing
the <img src="images/tile014.png"> <b>Generate Palette</b> button on the bottom
right. If a palette is not present, you won't be able to preview colors (they 
will show up as <span class="inlinecode">????</span> instead), and you cannot 
export the image. More information on palettes can be found in the 
<a href="204_palettes.html">Palettes</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Once you are happy with how everything is setup, you can compile your image by 
pressing the <img src="images/tile005.png"> <b>Compile Image</b> button on the 
bottom right, which will prompt you for the path to save the image to. The name
of the exported file can be changed by pressing the 
<img src="images/tile008.png"> <b>Rename Output</b> button on the menu bar.
</p>


<h3>Note on Compiling Images Out Of Bounds</h3>

<p>
If at any time your image gets exported with values that go out of bounds, such
as enabling the <b>Force power of two</b> checkbox, using chunk sizes that are
larger than the image, or using a 4-Bit color mode with an image that has an 
odd number of pixels, the outputted value will always be
<span class="inlinecode">0x00</span>.
