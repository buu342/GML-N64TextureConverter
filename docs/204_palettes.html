<h1>Palettes</h1>

<p>
In order to export images that use the Color Index mode, a palette is required.
A palette can be generated by pressing the <img src="images/tile014.png"> 
<b>Generate Palette</b> button, located on the bottom right of the program.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Nintend64 Texture Converter</i>, when using Color Index modes, will
automatically generate a palette by reading your image from top to bottom, 
left to right, adding any new colors it finds to a list. This list
can be previewed by clicking the <img src="images/tile019.png">
<b>View Palette</b> button.
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/palette.png" width="203" height="237"></br>
    <i>The palette viewer with 4-Bit CI mode selected.</br>
       Notice that Cyan is transparent.</i>
</center>

<p>
When modifying the image's alpha, either through changing the alpha mask,
changing the assigned <i>Single Color</i>, or even enabling/disabling the use
of alpha, the palette will automatically update, and it is not required to
regenerate the palette.
</p>

<p>
If your image contains more colors than what is supported by your chosen
color mode (16 in 4-Bit CI, 256 in 8-Bit CI), the palette generation will
fail, and you must dither the image using an external program to reduce
its colors.
</p>

<p>
The color preview matrix on the bottom left of the program will display
<span class="inlinecode">????</span> if no palettes are present. If a palette
is present (either an automatically generated one or an imported one), 
then placing the mouse over a texel will display the palette value instead 
(with the color it represents in parenthesis).
</p>


<h3>Importing/Exporting Palettes</h3>

<p>
You can export the current generated palette by pressing the 
<img src="images/tile002.png"> <b>Export Palette</b> button. This allows you to
re-import the palette into another image for previewing, or even compilation. 
Palette swaps are updated in realtime. Palettes are exported in <i>NPL</i> 
format, which will be explained shortly.
</p>

<p>
If you attempt to import a palette which contains more or less colors than what
is currently in your imported image, the program will warn you about this, but
allow you to import anyway.
</p>


<h3>Base Palette</h3>

<p>
Every time you import a new image, you must regenerate the palette. This can be
inconvenient if you want to import a collection of images, because the order of
the colors can change every time you regenerate the palette (due to the order 
in which colors are added to the list). As a result, you can choose to import a
<i>NPL</i> palette which can be used by all subsequent imported images. To make
a base palette, simply import an image which uses all the colors available in 
your collection, generate a palette, and export it. You can then import that 
palette as a base palette by pressing the <img src="images/tile001.png"> 
<b>Import Base Palette</b> button. The base palette should automatically update
in the palette preview.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> if one of your imported images contains a color that is not in the
base palette, the compilation will fail! <b>You must also ensure that the alpha
values match!</b>


<h3>NPL Format</h3>

<p>
The NPL format is very basic and can be modified with a text editor. All files
begin with the 3 letter header <span class="inlinecode">NPL</span> on its own 
line, followed by the list of colors in 32-Bit format, written in hexadecimal
notation. Every color is separated by a new line.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example <i>NPL</i> palette containing black, red, green, blue, and
white (in that order).
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
NPL
FF
FF0000FF
FF00FF
FFFF
FFFFFFFF
</pre>
</blockquote>
