<h1>Color Index Format</h1>

<p>
Color Index works differently from all the other color formats of the N64,
because instead of each texel containing the color values, it contains a number
which points to a list of colors. This list of colors is called the TLUT, which 
stands for <i>Texture Lookup Table</i>. If you've ever done sprite work, you 
might find the term <i>Palette</i> useful, as it's a very similar thing. 
</p>

<p>
The TLUT used by CI mode stores colors in 16-Bit RGBA format, with the amount
of colors dependent on the mode chosen. CI mode is a great tool if you're going
to be performing color swaps, as it means you don't need to have multiple
textures taking up precious ROM and RAM space. The biggest downside of CI mode,
however, is the fact that regardless of which mode you choose, the TLUT will 
always take up 2048 bytes of TMEM, despite the fact that it only requires
512 bytes...

<p>
CI mode is available in two formats:
</p>

<h3>8-Bit Color Index</h3>

<p>
In 8-Bit mode, the TLUT can have up to 256 colors. Each texel only occupies 
one byte, as its values only range from 
<span class="inlinecode">0x00</span> to
<span class="inlinecode">0xFF</span>. This gives you 2048 texels to work with,
as each texel only occupies 8 bits.
</p>

<h3>4-Bit Color Index</h3>

<p>
In 4-Bit mode, the image can have up to 16 colors, but you can cram up to 16 
different palettes into the TLUT (which helps reduce texture loading). The
reason for the reduced color depth is because now, instead of each texel
occupying 8 bits, they occupy 4, with the first 4 bits containing the odd
numbered texels and the last 4 bits containing the even numbered texels.

even number of texels.</i>
</p>

<p>
Thanks to its more compact form, 4-Bit CI allows up to 4096 texels to be used.
This lets you to have textures as large as 64x64!
