<h1>Chunking</h1>

<p>
When trying to use large textures, a common method of rendering them despite
the TMEM limitations is to break them into smaller chunks, rendering each
individually. The <i>Nintendo 64 Texture Converter</i> features a built in
image chunking option to aid in this process. It can be enabled by clicking
the <i>Chunk image</i> checkbox on the center of the bottom bar:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/chunk.png">
</center>

<p>
You can change the amount to chunk by simply typing sizes into the two input
boxes. The amount of bytes which your chunk will occupy will be shown on the 
TMEM section of the <i>Image Properties</i> section, located on the top right,
in parenthesis.
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/chunktmem.png"></br>
    <i>This 16x16 image has been chunked to 8x8, reducing each chunk's TMEM 
    usage from 512 to 128 bytes.</i>
</center>

<p>
Because chunking splits your image into multiple different ones, the name
of the exported files/arrays may need to be modified to differentiate between
the different chunks. Typically, <span class="inlinecode">_X_Y</span> will 
be appended to the end of the file name (if using <i>Binary File</i> export),
or to the end of the arrays. The <span class="inlinecode">X</span> represents 
the horizontal chunking value, and <span class="inlinecode">Y</span> represents
the vertical chunking value. Both start with <span class="inlinecode">1</span>, 
and increase based on the number of chunks generated.
</p>

<h3>Note on Chunking</h3>

If you attempt to use a chunking value which will result in part of, or the 
entirety of, a chunk to go out of bounds with your image's size (for instance,
using a chunking size of 32x32 on a 16x16 image), the values that are out of
bounds will be defaulted to the value of <span class="inlinecode">0</span>.
