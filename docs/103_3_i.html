<h1>Intensity Format</h1>

<p>
Intensity format is a purely black and white color format. Instead of each
texel containing color data, it instead contains color "intensity". Intensity, 
by default, does not support alpha.
</p>

<p>
On its own, having a black and white texture doesn't seem very useful, but 
combined with vertex colors, it can provide a lot of color variation to a 3D
scene, with the added bonus of supporting large textures. As an example, take 
the following black and white 64x64 texture:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/dirttex.png">
</center>

<p>
Here's an example 3D scene of a dirt path near a rocky cliff. The entire scene
uses only the above texture, combined with vertex colors:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/dirtpath.png" width="339" height="247"></br>
<i>If you right click the photo, you should be able to access a full quality

</center>

<p>
As you can see, thanks to vertex colors, we can make the texture look more
varied. Not only that, vertex colors gives us a lot of powerful tools, allowing
you to fake shadows and Ambient Occulsion with little performance impact!
</p>

<p>
Intensity format comes in two forms:
</p>

<h3>8-Bit Intensity</h3>

<p>
8-Bit Intensity is the easiest format to cover. Essentially, every texel is one
byte of color intensity, ranging from <span class="inlinecode">0x00</span> 
(black) to <span class="inlinecode">0xFF</span> (white), for a total of 256 
shades. This gives you 4096 texels to work with, which is enough for a 64x64 
texture.
</p>

<h3>4-Bit Intensity</h3>

<p>
Like with 4-Bit Color Index, each texel now actually represents two, as the 
first 4 bits of the texture contain the odd column of texels, and the last 4
contain the even texels column. This, of course, means that you are reduced to
only 16 shades, but compensated with 8192 texels, allowing you to have textures
as large as 90x90, 128x64, etc...
