<h1>Intensity With Alpha Format</h1>

<p>
This format is incredibly similar to <i>Intensity</i> format, except this one
trades color depth for the ability to use alpha.
</p>

<p>
There are three different variations on the IA format:
</p>

<h3>16-Bit Intensity + Alpha</h3>

<p>
In this format, each texel takes up two bytes. The first 8 bits represent the 
color intensity of the texel, ranging from <span class="inlinecode">0x00</span>
(black) to <span class="inlinecode">0xFF</span> (white). The last 8 bits are
for alpha, also ranging from <span class="inlinecode">0x00</span> (transparent)
to <span class="inlinecode">0xFF</span> (opaque). Due to both intensity and 
transparency having 256 different shades, this format only allows for 2048 
texels.
</p>

<h3>8-Bit Intensity + Alpha</h3>

<p>
In 8-Bit mode, each texel takes up a byte, with the first 4 bits being the 
color intensity and the last 4 bits being the alpha. This allows for 16 shades
of intensity and 16 shades of alpha, giving you 4096 texels to work with.
</p>

<h3>4-Bit Intensity + Alpha</h3>

<p>
Much like 4-Bit CI and 4-Bit I, this mode fits in 2 texels into one. In this
case, each texel is 4 bits, with the first 3 bits being the intensity, and 1
bit being the alpha (essentially only allowing for alpha to be on or off).
This format allows for 8192 texels in total.
