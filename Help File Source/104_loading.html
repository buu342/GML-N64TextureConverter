<h1>Loading Textures</h1>

<p>
As explained previously, all images must be loaded into TMEM in order to be 
rendered by the RDP. This section will cover some of the effects that can be
achieved during this loading process.
</p>


<h3>S and T coordinates</h3>

<p>
If you have 3D modeling experience, you have probably heard the term 
<i>UV Mapping</i>. You can think of <i>S T</i> coordinates as something 
similar. <i>S T</i> coordinates are composed of 4 numbers, the first two 
representing the <span class="inlinecode">X</span> and 
<span class="inlinecode">Y</span> coordinates of the top left corner of a
rectangle, and the last two representing the 
<span class="inlinecode">X</span> and <span class="inlinecode">Y</span> 
coordinates of the bottom right corner of a rectangle. This rectangle will
define how our image will be displayed. Think of it like your image is a flat
batch of cookie dough, and that the <i>S T</i> coordinates describe the size
and position of your cookie cutter, which will create a hole in the dough. 
The dough that is inside your cookie cutter will be what the N64 displays. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, lets imagine that we loaded the following 32x32 texture into
TMEM:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/icecream.png">
</center>

<p>
You can think of the image as being in a 32x32 grid of pixels, with the top 
left corner being 
<span class="inlinecode">X</span> <span class="inlinecode">Y</span> coordinate
<span class="inlinecode">(0, 0)</span> and the bottom right corner being 
coordinate <span class="inlinecode">(31, 31)</span>.

<center>
    <img src="images/icecreamtmem.png"></br>
    <i>Visual representation of the texture in TMEM.</i>
</center>

<p>
But now, let's say that you don't want to display the full 32x32 image, but 
rather, only the first 16x16 pixels. In that case, our S T coordinates would be
<span class="inlinecode">(0, 0)</span> and
<span class="inlinecode">(15, 15)</span>, which is the red square highlighted
here:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/tmemchunk1.png">
</center>

<p>
Which would render the following 16x16 image to the screen:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/chunk1.png">
</center>

<p>
Similarly, if we wanted the last 16x16 pixels, our <i>S T</i> coordinates would
be <span class="inlinecode">(16, 16)</span> and
<span class="inlinecode">(31, 31)</span>:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/tmemchunk2.png">
</center>

<p>
Effectively rendering:

<p>
By playing with <i>S T</i> coordinates, you can do all sorts of tricks which 
will be covered shortly.
</p>

<h3>Loading Textures</h3>

<p>
Without getting too technical, it's helpful to understand what parameters the 
programmer needs to pass in code to load your texture. The following pseudocode
should hopefully give you an idea:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
LoadTexture(
    Format,                  // Whether to use RGBA, CI, etc...
    Depth,                   // 32 bit, 16 bit, 8 bit, or 4 bit
    Width,    Height,        // Number of pixels to render
    S_Effect, T_Effect,      // Effect to apply
    S_Mask,   T_Mask,        // Mask to use
    S_LOD,    T_LOD          // LOD to use
);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In case you're wondering what <span class="inlinecode">Effect</span>, 
<span class="inlinecode">Mask</span>, and 
<span class="inlinecode">LOD</span> are, this will be covered very shortly.

<h3>Masks</h3>

<p>
When loading textures into memory, one of the values which the programmer will
need to provide is the <i>mask value</i>. It is a number which represents a
power of two , and tells the RDP to perform the operations (which will be 
discussed very shortly) on this region of the texture. So for instance, a mask
value of 4 and 5 tells RDP to perform effects on the first 16x32 texels. The
requirement of the mask value being a power of two is a good reason to ensure 
that your textures are a power of two whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
As an example, lets imagine the following 16x16 texture:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/swordexample.png">
</center>

<p>
Your programmer can choose to render it as 32x32, however the N64 is not able
to stretch the texture to fit this space. As a result, what happens to the 
texture is dictated by a combination of the mask value, and the chosen effect.
</p>


<h3>Effect: Clamping</h3>

<p>
Clamping will cause a texture to repeat its borders' colors. For instance, 
setting both the <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> effect to <i>clamp</i>, and attempting
to render the 16x16 texture in a 32x32 box (with mask values set to 
<span class="inlinecode">4</span> on both <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> mask) will 
yield the following:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/swordclamp.png">
</center>

<h3>Effect: Wrapping</h3>

<p>
Wrap will cause the texture to repeat itself. Once again, setting both the 
<i>S</i> and <i>T</i> effect to <i>wrap</i>, and attempting to render the 16x16
texture in a 32x32 box (with mask values set to 
<span class="inlinecode">4</span> on both <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> mask) will
yield the following:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/swordwrap.png">
</center>


<h3>Effect: Mirroring</h3>

<p>
Mirroring is similar to wrapping, except the texture will be flipped. Rendering
using the same parameters as the last two effects results in:
</p>

    <img src="images/swordmirror.png">
</center>


<h3>Combining Effects and Masks</h3>

<p>
Now that you have an idea of the different types of effects possible, I will
demonstrate some of the things that can be done by combining different values.
</p>

<p>
For example, if we try to render our 16x16 texture in a 16x16 rectangle, using
a mask value of <span class="inlinecode">3</span> and 
<span class="inlinecode">4</span>, we would get the following:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/effect1.png">
</center>

<p>
But now, if we enable clamping and render in a 32x32 rectangle, the result will
be:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/effect2.png">
</center>

<p>
Changing <i>clamp</i> to <i>wrap</i> instead:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/effect3.png">
</center>

<p>
And now, changing to <i>mirror</i>:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/effect4.png">
</center>

<p>
Both <i>wrapping</i> and <i>mirroring</i> are a very useful tool. Wrapping lets
us have a texture repeat on forever (such as a brick texture). Mirroring allows
us, with the right <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> coordinate combination, to render a
mirrored copy of our texture without needing to have a separate texture (useful
for character sprites). Mirroring also allows us to make a texture look larger 
than it actually is, given that it is symmetrical on one axis.
</p>


<h3>LODs</h3>

<p>
Changing the LOD value will cause a texture to repeat pixels. For instance, 
setting LOD to 1 will cause the pixel to be drawn 1 more time after it was 
drawn, resulting in us being able to make a texture fill the rendered 
rectangle (if it is smaller, like when we tried rendering a 16x16 texture in a
32x32 box). As an example, this is the result of setting the LOD value to 
<span class="inlinecode">0</span> and <span class="inlinecode">1</span>
(rendering the texture in a 32x32 rectangle with <i>wrapping</i>):
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/LOD1.png">
</center>

<p>
The LOD value will not ignore the mask, meaning if we were to use mask values 
<span class="inlinecode">3</span> and <span class="inlinecode">4</span>, while
rendering in a 32x32 box with <i>mirror</i>, the result would be:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/LOD2.png">
</center>

<p>
The LOD number can go as high as 15, but from 11 onwards it will actually 
work backwards. That means that at <span class="inlinecode">15</span>, it 
will skip every 1 pixel. <span class="inlinecode">14</span> will skip 2, 
<span class="inlinecode">13</span> skips 3, 
<span class="inlinecode">11</span> skips 5. Here is what the LOD value of
<span class="inlinecode">0</span> and <span class="inlinecode">1</span>
would look like, rendered on a 16x8 rectangle:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/LOD3.png">
</center>

<p>
These skips will also be affected by your mask and effects! So for instance, 
drawing our 16x16 sprite in a 32x32 rectangle with the <i>S</i> and <i>T</i>
effect both set to <i>mirror</i>, both masks set to 
<span class="inlinecode">4</span>, and both LOD's set to 15, the following 
will be rendered:
</p>
