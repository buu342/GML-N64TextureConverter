<h1>RGBA Format</h1>

<p>
RGBA is the format that's easiest to explain, as you are bound to already have
plenty of experience with it. Texels consist of a combination of red, green, 
blue, and alpha (transparency). RGBA format comes in two flavours:
</p>

<h3>32 Bits</h3>

<p>
In 32-Bit RGBA, each color is composed of 1 byte. This means that you can have 
256 different shades of red, green, blue, and alpha (ranging from 0 to 255), or
in other words, each shade is composed of 8 bits. White would be represented as
<span class="inlinecode">0xFFFFFFFF</span>, black as 
<span class="inlinecode">0x000000FF</span>, and semi transparent red as 
<span class="inlinecode">0xFF00007F</span>.

<p>
The advantage of using 32-Bit RGBA is that you get a lot of color and alpha, 
but its biggest downside is the fact that each texel takes up 4 bytes, 
resulting in you only having 1024 texels to work with. This means your textures
will typically have a size of 32x32, 16x48, etc...
</p>

<h3>16 Bits</h3>

<p>
16-Bit RGBA is a more compact version of 32-Bit RGBA. Instead of each color 
occupying 8 bits, they occupy 5 bits instead (with alpha only having 1 bit, 
meaning the pixel is either transparent, or not).

<p>
Thanks to its compact form, a single texel only occupies 2 bytes, giving you
2048 texels to work with (double of 32-Bit RGBA). This lets you have textures
like 32x64, 48x48, etc...
