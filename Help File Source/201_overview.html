<h1>Program Overview</h1>

<p>
The <i>Nintendo64 Texture Converter</i> is a GUI based tool which allows you
to import images in a myriad of formats, and export them as one of the many 
different image formats supported by the default Nintendo 64 microcode. 
</p>

<p>
When you start the <i>Nintendo64 Texture Converter</i>, the following form is
shown:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/progstart.png" width="403" height="316">
</center>

<p>
On the top, you should have the familiar menu bar. On the left, you'll have a
lot of options relating to your image and how it will be exported. On the 
bottom, you'll have more options relating to how your texture is handled by the
export. Note that many similar things can be achieved in different ways, such
as: choosing a command from the menu, clicking a button, or by using a keyboard
shortcut.
</p>

<h3>Icon Buttons</h3>

<p>
The menu bar on the top of the form features a bunch of different icons. Here
is a quick overview of what each one does:
</p>

<ul>

    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Information</h3>

<p>
Upon importing an image into the program, information relevant to your image 
is displayed on the top left:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/imageinfo.png">
</center>

<p>
The meaning of each row is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>File</b>: This is the name that will be used for the file when 
        you export your compiled image. It can be modified by pressing the
        <img src="images/tile008.png"> <b>Rename Output</b> icon button.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Array</b>: This is the name that will be used for the arrays (that
        store your image information in code) when you export your 
        compiled image. If you are using <b>Binary File</b> as your export 
        mode, this is not displayed. It can be modified by pressing the
        <img src="images/tile008.png"> <b>Rename Output</b> icon button. Array
        names cannot start with numbers, and can only consist of alphanumeric 
        characters or underscores.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Size</b>: This is the size of your imported image0s width and height
        (in pixels).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>TMEM</b>: This is the size of your imported image (in texels). If
        your image (in the <b>Image Type</b> mode you have selected) surpasses
        the 4096 byte limit of TMEM, it will be displayed in red. If you have 
        selected the <b>Chunk image</b> checkbox, the size of each one of your 
        chunked images (in texels) will be displayed in parenthesis.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Image Type</h3>

<p>
Under the <b>Image Information</b> section, you have the <b>Image Type</b> 
section:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/imagetype.png">
</center>

<p>
This lets you select the texture format which your image gets exported
as, by selecting one of the radial buttons. An explanation of each image
type can be found in the <a href="103_formats.html">Image Formats</a> 
section of this manual. You can also change the background color of your
image, provided it contains alpha, by clicking the colored square. 
More information on how to use alpha is available in the 
<a href="203_usingalpha.html">Using Alpha</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Export Format</h3>

<p>
Under the <b>Image Type</b> section, you have the <b>Export Format</b> 
section:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/exportmode.png">
</center>

<p>
The meaning of each button is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Header</b>: A standard C header file with your image data in an
        array format. This header does not contain include guards (as they
        are useless due to the array being declared), therefore this format
        should only be used if it is known that the image will be
        <span class="inlinecode">#include</span>'ed once.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>C + Header</b>: A combination of a C and header file, with your
        image data in an array format. The C file must be compiled on its own,
        but because the header file uses 
        <span class="inlinecode">extern</span> (as well as include guards) your
        image can be <span class="inlinecode">#include</span>'ed in multiple 
        files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Binary File</b>: A binary file with the raw texel data in it. This
        is the best image format for large homebrew, but requires that your
        data be linked into the ROM and DMA'd to RAM manually. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
When exporting an image with palettes's, the TLUT data is placed in the same 
file as your texel data, albiet in a separate array which uses the same name
as your main image, except ending with <span class="inlinecode">_tlut</span>.
In <b>Binary File</b> mode, a second file is exported instead, following the
same naming scheme. More information on palettes can be found in the 
<a href="204_palettes.html">Palettes</a> page.
</p>

<p>
If chunking mode is used, the texel array will be split into multiple arrays,
albiet ending with <span class="inlinecode">_X_Y</span>, where 
<span class="inlinecode">X</span> represents the N'th horizontal chunk and 
<span class="inlinecode">Y</span> represents the N'th vertical chunk. In 
<b>Binary File</b> mode, multiple files are created instead, following the
same naming scheme. More information on chunking can be found in the
<a href="205_chunking.html">Chunking</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Color Preview</h3>

<p>
Under the <b>Export Format</b> section, you have the <b>Color Previewer</b> 
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/pixelinfo.png">
</center>

<p>
If you mouse over parts of your image, this section will display what that
specific texel will be exported as. Each row represents the color and alpha
value (be it in RGB, YUV, or I format) in 8 bit format, hexadecimal format,
or a smaller format (if applicable). If the smaller format exists, the 
hexadecimal value will represent that, and not the 8 bit color!
</p>

<p>
Below the color matrix is a preview of the output texel with all the bits
properly combines, in hexadecimal format, as well as a color preview box of
the pixel that the mouse is currently over. 
</p>

<p>
If a format that uses palettes is selected, the output texel may show up as
<span class="inlinecode">????</span> if no palette (either an 
automatically generated one or an imported one) is present. If a palette
is present, then placing the mouse over a texel will display the palette value
instead (with the color it represents in parenthesis). More information on 
palettes can be found in the <a href="204_palettes.html">Palettes</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Bottom Bar</h3>

<p>
The bottom bar contains a few checkboxes and selections that allow you to 
change certain things regarding how your image is exported. This section looks
like this:
</p>

<center>
    <img src="images/bottom.png">
</center>

<p>
The meaning of each button is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Use Alpha</b>: Enables/disables the use of alpha. If enabled, you 
        can choose between using the alpha mask, or using a single color. If 
        single color mode is selected, you can change the color that will be 
        used for alpha by placing your mouse over the image in the preview
        and left clicking on the pixel with the color you wish to set 
        transparent. More information on alpha can be found in the
        <a href="203_usingalpha.html">Using Alpha</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Add dummy aligners</b>: If a non-binary <b>Export Format</b> is 
        selected, dummy aligners will be added to the exported array's
        definitions. The dummy aligners are used to properly align the textures
        in memory, and might lead to problems if not present. Uncheck if you
        know what you are doing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Force power of two</b>: This forces your image size to be exported
        as a power of two (for instance, 32x32, 128x64, etc...). This is 
        recommended your image is not already a power of two <b>and</b> 
        masking is going to be used (to allow for effects such as mirroring 
        and LODs). Texels outside of your image's size will use the value of
        0. More information on masking can be found in the 
        <a href="104_loading.html">Loading Textures</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Chunk image</b>: This splits your image into chunks with the size of 
        your choosing. More information on chunking can be found in the
        <a href="205_chunking.html">Chunking</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Generate Palette</b>: If an image mode that supports palletes is 
        used, this button will generate a palette based on the imported image.
        More information on palettes can be found in the 
        <a href="204_palettes.html">Palettes</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Compile Image</b>: Exports the imported image in the 
        <b>Export Format</b> you have selected.
    </li>
</ul>
