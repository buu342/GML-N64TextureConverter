<h1>TMEM</h1>

<p>
As mentioned in the previous section, the RDP contains a single cache called
TMEM, which is shorthand for Texture Memory. This cache is 4 kilobytes in size
(4096 bytes), and any texture which the RDP wants to use <b>must be loaded into
TMEM first</b>. There's <b>no way to circumvent this 4 kilobyte limitation</b>,
so it is your duty to ensure that your texture can be, in some way, twisted to
fit into this 4kb limit.
</p>

<p>
This can be done by choosing the correct image format, by breaking your 
texture down into smaller bits, or by designing your texture in a way that it
can be easily broken down manually by your programmer (AKA tiles). There are 
some texture effects that can be used by you to make your texture look larger 
than it actually is, which will be covered in the <a href="104_loading.html">
Loading Textures</a> page.

<p>
When rendering 3D polygons, the Nintendo 64 only supports 1 texture per 
triangle, so if you wish to render a large texture (larger than 4kb), you must
divide your model into multiple smaller faces. For example, the paintings in
Super Mario 64 are 64x64 pixels in size. This is too large to fit into TMEM 
(You'll understand why in the <a href="103_formats.html">Image Formats</a> 
page), therefore in order to render it, the painting model needs to split up 
into chunks:
