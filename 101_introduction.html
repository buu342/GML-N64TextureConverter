<p>
The Nintendo 64 features two processors:
<ul>
  <li>The main CPU, which is a 64-bit NEC VR4300. This is where most of the 
      game logic runs.</li>
  <li>The Reality Coprocessor (or RCP for short), which handles graphics, 
      audio, and I/O.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The RCP is split into two different sections (not including the I/O chip):
<ul>
  <li>The Reality Display Processor (or RDP for short). This chip handles
      the actual rendering of polygons.</li>
  <li>The Reality Signal Processor (or RSP for short). This chip receives
      drawing instructions from the CPU (in the format of a Display List),
      and, using <i>microcode</i> (a custom made program that tells the RSP 
      how to behave), tells the RDP how to draw to the screen.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The CPU and the RCP work in parallel to process and render the game. The 
focus of these pages will be on the RDP, which is the part that handles the 
actual drawing of polygons. But in order to render textures, the RCP needs
access to the data from somewhere. 
</p>

<p>
The obvious solution would be to fetch the data from RAM, but this brings a 
few problems. First of all, the CPU also has access to the data in RAM, so
there is no guarantee that the textures will not be modified as the RDP is
trying to render polygons. The other problem is the fact that RAM can be slow
to access. Because of this, processors have a little memory chip embedded into
them called a <i>cache</i>. Caches are usually very small in size (usually
just a few kilobytes), but are incredibly fast to read and write. The RDP
contains a single cache called TMEM, which will be covered in more depth in the
<a href="102_tmem.html">TMEM</a> page.
</p>


<h3>Binary Notation</h3>

<p>
Computers work on electricity, and for simplicity sake, lets say that 
electricity only exists in two different states: On and Off (1 and 0). Because
computers only work with 0's and 1's, there needs to be a way to convert
numbers into a format that computers can understand.
</p>

<p>
When you count, you probably do it in "base ten". This means that you only use a 
combination of ten different symbols to identify your numbers. These are:
</p>

<p>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</p>

<p>
When you start counting numbers, you start from 0 and go all the way to 9. But
when you try to count past 9, the next number is 10, which is composed of two
symbols instead of just one. Because there is no symbol for a number past 9,
you simply reset 9 back to 0, and you increase the number next to the 9 (which 
went from 0 to 1).
</p>

<p>
Binary numbers work in the exact same way, except instead of having ten 
different symbols, you only have two: 0 and 1. This is called "base two". 
An individual 0 or 1 is called a <i>bit</i>.
</p>

<p>
Counting in binary follows the exact same pattern as counting in base ten. 
Here is an example table counting to 10 (Note, I have included extra 0's 
on the left side of each number to make the table easier to read):
</p>

<center>
    <table>
        <tr>
        <th>Base 10 || </th>
        <th>Base 2</th> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>00</td>
            <td>0000</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>01</td>
            <td>0001</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>02</td>
            <td>0010</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>03</td>
            <td>0011</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>04</td>
            <td>0100</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>05</td>
            <td>0101</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>06</td>
            <td>0110</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>07</td>
            <td>0111</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>08</td>
            <td>1000</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>09</td>
            <td>1001</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>1010</td> 
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>
Another way to visualize binary numbers is that each digit represents a power
of two. For instance, the number <span class="inlinecode">342</span>, in base
10, can be broken down like this:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/342base10.png">
</center>

<p>
342 in base 2 is <span class="inlinecode">101010110</span>. You can break it
down like this:
</p>

<center>
<img src="images/342base2.png">
</center>

<p>
Now of course, this explanation is missing a lot of key information, such as
how negative numbers are represented, and how to write decimals. These are not
important to understand what is going to be discussed in this help document,
therefore if you wish to learn more about binary notation, you'll need to 
research that on your own.
</p>


<h3>Hexadecimal Notation</h3>

<p>
In computer science, it is convention to group binary numbers in groups of 8.
That's why processors tend to be 8, 16, 32, or 64 bit, and not some other
number. A group of 8 bits is referred to as a <i>byte</i>. This means that a 
byte can range from <span class="inlinecode">0</span> to 
<span class="inlinecode">255</span> (which is equivalent to eight 1's). 
</p>

<p>
You would think that in computer science, the preferred way of counting numbers
is with base eight (also known as <i>octal</i>), but that is not the case. 
Instead, base sixteen is used, which is known as <i>hexadecimal</i> (or <i>hex
</i> for short). So your first question might be: "If we only have ten 
different symbols to represent numbers, how do you represent numbers like 10 
and 11?". The answer is that the letters <span class="inlinecode">A</span> 
through <span class="inlinecode">F</span> are used instead. This means that 
10 is represented by <span class="inlinecode">A</span>, 11 by 
<span class="inlinecode">B</span>, etc... All the way until 15, which is 
<span class="inlinecode">F</span>.
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few ways to begin a hexadecimal number's representation, but
the most common is to start with <span class="inlinecode">0x</span>. Some 
programming languages perfer to use a <span class="inlinecode">$</span> symbol 
to indicate the start of a hexadecimal number, but the former is much more 
common.
</p>

<p>
Base sixteen is useful to us because it makes it very obvious when a a byte
starts or begins. The largest number possible with a single byte is 
<span class="inlinecode">255</span>, which is represented as
<span class="inlinecode">0xFF</span> in hexadecimal. Knowing that, you should 
understand that you can identify bytes by simply counting two letters or 
numbers. As an example, the number <span class="inlinecode">342</span> in 
hexadecimal notation is represented as <span class="inlinecode">0x0156</span>.
Looking at it, you should be able to conclude that you need two bytes to be 
able to store the number <span class="inlinecode">342</span> in memory.
</p>

<p>
From here on out, there is going to be a lot of hexadecimal numbers, so it is
important that you understand them well.
</p>


<h3>Display Lists</h3>

<p>
It was mentioned that the CPU generates a list of commands which get sent to
the RCP. These instructions are received by the RSP and then sent to the RDP
for rendering. There is a very long list of the different types of display 
list commands available in the N64 reference manual which will not be covered
in these pages. 
</p>

<p>
Display lists come in two different formats, dynamic and static. In this 
manual, display lists will be written in static format. It is, however, 
very easy to swap between the two, so it should not be too much of a problem
if you wish to use dynamic display lists instead.
</p>

<p>
Your programmer, in order to generate a display list to load your texture, 
needs to know what type of format you exported your images as, as well as their
size (in pixels). So it is important that you tell him about that!
